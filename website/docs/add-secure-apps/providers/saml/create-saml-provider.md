title: Create a SAML provider
---

To create a provider along with the corresponding application that uses it for authentication, navigate to **Applications** > **Applications** and click **Create with provider**. We recommend this combined approach for most common use cases. Alternatively, you can follow the legacy method by navigating to **Applications** > **Providers** and clicking **Create**.

1. Log in to authentik as an administrator, and open the authentik Admin interface.

2. Navigate toÂ **Applications > Applications** and click **Create with provider** to create an application and provider pair.

3. On the **New application** page, define the application details, and then click **Next**.

4. Select **SAML Provider** as the **Provider Type**, and then click **Next**.

5. On the **Configure SAML Provider** page, provide the configuration settings and then click **Submit** to create both the application and the provider.

TODO describe each field.... maybe. There are some very important fields under Advanced Protocol settings...
